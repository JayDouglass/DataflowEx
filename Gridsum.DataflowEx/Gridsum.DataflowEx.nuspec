    <summary>Gridsum's Object-Oriented extensions and helpers to TPL Dataflow</summary>
    <description>
      Gridsum.DataflowEx provides Object-Oriented extensions to TPL Dataflow library.
      You can write reusable components with mutable states and easily join them as a high-level graph while still having the power of low level blocks from TPL Dataflow. Other cool features include: Upstream failure propagation, built-in performance monitor, auto complete support, sql bulk inserter, etc. Find more at https://github.com/gridsum/dataflowex.
